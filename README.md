# NOTE
## BUGS / ISSUES
- Does not work in incognito. Incognito doesn't save cookies and as such the webapp simply does not work.
- Having two session running on the same browser instance will lead to the original instance's requests being made as the second intsance. In short it would be wise not to open two instances of the site at the same time.
